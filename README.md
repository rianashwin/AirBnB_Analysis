 Analysis of AirBnB Data

Inspired by Eric Bruin's analysis of AirBnB listings for Amsterdam https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/airbnb-the-amsterdam-story-with-interactive-maps, leveraging Folium to build interactive maps, I decided to recreate the same but for London. This city gave me some of my fondest memories and am very much looking forward to being back there at some point.


In this notebook -  we use plotly and Folium to build interactive visualisations. Feel free to download the notebook and check out the analysis I've included. This time, not much around machine learning. Instead, I aimed to frame specific research questions and use simple visualisations to communicate the possible answers. 

Separately, data is sourced from insideairbnb.com. This is a great website which aims to use data to uncover the actual effects of AirBnB towards local housing markets and communities. Please check them out!
